# Market-Making DRL
This module is a Python-based framework for implementing market-making strategies in cryptocurrency trading using deep reinforcement learning. It supports Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), and an Ensemble Agent. The project is designed to simulate market-making environments and provide a benchmark against the Avellaneda-Stoikov model. 

This project is part of the research study:
"Automated Market-Making via Ensemble Deep Reinforcement Learning in Cryptocurrency"
